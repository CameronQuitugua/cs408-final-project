# Coffee Shop Forum

## Project Spec

The Coffee Bar Forum app is designed to be a platform aimed at coffee enthusiasts to connect them and help in discovering new coffee shops and share experiences. To be more specific, the purpose of this app is to help people find new places to try coffee, share descriptions of drinks or other items that they particularly enjoyed, share experiences about specific coffee shops they visited, and much more. This app can also be used to help people find coffee shops that are affordable, that are cool places to relax and study, that are close in proximity to their current locations, and even help new and local businesses gain more traction and exposure. This app will include a page displaying a form that will request specific information that will be posted to the forum. A few of the items of information that will be asked include the name of the coffee shop that was visited, the location of the coffee shop (could be a specific address or just the city/state), a rating scale starting from 1 to 5 stars, a description of their experience (this description will be aimed more towards a description of the coffee shop rather than a general review). The form that requests information from users will include inputs that are required, such as the ones listed above, and optional inputs. Some optional inputs could be something such as a description of the drink user’s got, a scale to describe the affordability of the coffee shop starting from 1 going to 5, and maybe other kinds of inputs. This app will most likely include functionality to present the option to rate the coffee shop with star symbols and scale its affordability with dollar signs. Where the fewer the stars the worse the coffee shop is and the fewer dollars the cheaper it is. For example, users have the option to click 5 out of 5 stars to describe a phenomenal coffee shop and a 1 out of 5 dollar sign to describe a super cheap and affordable coffee shop. This app will be split into multiple separate pages to create less clutter on a single page, creating a more visually appealing app that is easier to navigate. One page will be informative, describing the app, the purpose of the app, and what it can do. Another page will be dedicated to the form users will be submitting, this will include all of the input described earlier as a series of test boxes. Another page will be dedicated to every entry made into the forum posted with the most recent post made coming on top. Another page will be dedicated to searching for reviews on specific coffee shops by name. When this app is fully developed, I hope to further add more functionality. A few features that I’d consider adding include a Maps section to visually see the location of coffee shops on maps, functionality to maybe filter search by coffee drinks or other keywords, create a gallery compiled from photos from different reviews, and maybe even accounts to login with.
